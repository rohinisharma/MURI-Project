# Object Recognition Code for Attention and Perception Lab

This code is part of an experiment done in the Attention and Perception Lab, with Professor Diane Beck.
Object recognition models like ResNet 150 are used to predict which of 16 chosen categories a given image falls into.
The performance of this program was compared with humans tasked with the same goal, in order to compare the object recognition capabilities 
of computer and human vision.
